## Advanced Todo List CLI Application - Project Concept

- The Advanced Todo List CLI Application is a command-line tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It aims to combine the simplicity and speed of a command-line interface with the power and features typically found in graphical todo applications.

## Core Concept:
- Users interact with the application entirely through the command line, performing actions like adding tasks, marking them as complete, categorizing them, and viewing their todo list. As the project progresses, more advanced features will be added to enhance task management capabilities.

## Key Features (evolving through development stages):

1. Basic Task Management:
   - Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks
   - Tasks have a description and a completion status

2. Enhanced Organization:
   - Tasks can be categorized and prioritized
   - Users can reorder tasks based on importance

3. Advanced Functionality:
   - Due dates and reminders for tasks
   - Analytics to track productivity and task completion rates
   - Data import/export for backup and sharing

## User Experience:
- The application will start as a simple, text-based interface and evolve to use more sophisticated CLI libraries for improved visual presentation and user interaction. Despite being command-line based, the aim is to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Data Handling:
- Task data will be stored locally using a SQLite database, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval. The database structure will evolve as new features are added.

## Development Approach:
- The project will be developed incrementally, starting with basic functionality and progressively adding more complex features. This approach allows for continuous improvement and aligns with the assessment criteria progression from pass to distinction levels.

## Target Users:
- This application is designed for individuals comfortable with command-line interfaces, such as developers, system administrators, or tech-savvy professionals who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and appreciate the efficiency of CLI tools.

By focusing on both functionality and user experience within the constraints of a CLI, this project aims to create a powerful, efficient, and unique task management tool that demonstrates a range of Python programming skills and software development best practices.

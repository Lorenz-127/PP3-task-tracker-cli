# Advanced Todo List CLI Application Roadmap and Criteria Checklist

This combined roadmap and checklist ensures that I'm addressing all the learning outcomes and criteria as I progress through my project, from pass level through to distinction. It provides me with a clear path for development while also serving as a checklist to ensure I'm meeting all the necessary requirements. I need to remember to refer back to this document regularly throughout my development process to stay on track and ensure I'm meeting all the criteria.

   - [ ] Refactor code for better organization and readability (M1.1)
   - [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions and code style (LO1: 1.3)
   - [ ] Implement more granular functions for better logic flow (M2.1)
   - [ ] Clearly separate application code from external sources (LO2: 2.2, M6.1)

7. Enhanced Data Model
   - [ ] Update database schema to include categories and position fields
   - [ ] Implement data validation for all inputs

8. Improved CLI Interface
   - [ ] Integrate Rich library for improved formatting and user feedback
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and user notifications

9. Testing - Merit Level
   - [ ] Implement and document comprehensive manual testing procedures (M5.2)
   - [ ] Use PEP8 validator and document results
   - [ ] Document validation error-based fixes and any unsolved validation errors (M5.1)

10. Documentation - Merit Level
    - [ ] Create flow charts or diagrams for application logic (M4.1)
    - [ ] Enhance README with project rationale and detailed user instructions (M8.4)
    - [ ] Document library choices and their rationale (M8.1)
    - [ ] Demonstrate, through screenshots, what the project outcomes are and how they have been met (M8.3)

11. Version Control
    - [ ] Implement Conventional Commits for clear, descriptive commit messages
    - [ ] Ensure frequent, small, well-defined commits (M8.2)

12. Deployment - Merit Level
    - [ ] Document detailed deployment procedure in README (M9.1)

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Optimizations (Distinction Level)

13. Advanced Task Management Features
    - [ ] Implement task prioritization system
    - [ ] Add due dates and reminders functionality
    - [ ] Implement color-coded categories
    - [ ] Ensure all features align with key project goals (M7.1)

14. Analytics and Reporting
    - [ ] Develop basic analytics features (e.g., tasks completed per category, completion rate)
    - [ ] Implement data visualization for analytics (e.g., using Rich or ASCII charts)

15. Performance Optimization
    - [ ] Optimize database queries for improved performance (D7)
    - [ ] Implement efficient data structures and algorithms where applicable (D1, D2)

16. Advanced Error Handling and Input Validation
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for all possible scenarios (D5)
    - [ ] Develop robust input validation system

17. Security Enhancements
    - [ ] Implement secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., using environment variables)
    - [ ] Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized

18. Data Import/Export Functionality
    - [ ] Implement feature to export todo data (e.g., to CSV or JSON)
    - [ ] Add functionality to import data from external sources

19. Testing - Distinction Level
    - [ ] Implement unit tests for critical functions
    - [ ] Consider implementing integration tests

20. Documentation - Distinction Level
    - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
    - [ ] Provide detailed setup guide and usage examples
    - [ ] Document all advanced features and their use cases (D4)

21. Final Deployment and Optimization
    - [ ] Ensure deployed application is optimized for performance
    - [ ] Conduct final security checks
    - [ ] Execute a flawless deployment with additional optimizations (D9)

22. Reflection and Future Improvements
    - [ ] Write a detailed reflection on the development process
    - [ ] Outline potential future improvements and features

Throughout all phases:
- Regularly update the README.md file as new features are implemented

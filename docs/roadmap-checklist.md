# Revised Roadmap and Criteria Checklist for Task Tracker CLI

This combined roadmap and checklist ensures that I'm addressing all the learning outcomes and criteria as I progress through my project, from pass level through to distinction. It provides me with a clear path for development while also serving as a checklist to ensure I'm meeting all the necessary requirements. I need to remember to refer back to this document regularly throughout my development process to stay on track and ensure I'm meeting all the criteria.
